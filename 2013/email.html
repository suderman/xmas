  Jon & Janessa Suderman's 2013 Newsletter!</h1>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>lthough later than usual,</strong> I simply could not pass up the opportunity to jot down the events in our lives this past year. And what makes this extra-special is that 2013 marks the first postnuptial newsletter! One flesh, folks!
</p>

<img align="right" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/ski.jpg" width="300" height="380" /> 

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  J</span>anuary 2013 was the last January I'd spend unmarried,</strong> living the bachelor life with my brother, Andrew, and Braden. That said, I don't think I saw very much of them. I spent nearly all my free time with my fianc&eacute;e (who was living with her older brother, Luke), and wedding planning was well underway. We had already booked our venue at the <a href="http://www.calgaryzoo.com">Calgary Zoo</a> last October, and now I was experiencing the fascinating world of <a href="http://www.theweddingfair.ca/">bridal expos</a>. It's like paying to walk through an infomercial, with contests I never win.</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  We kept active cross-country skiing in <a href="http://www.albertaparks.ca/peter-lougheed/information-facilities/special-facilities/pocaterra-warming-hut.aspx">Pocaterra</a> and in <a href="http://www.albertaparks.ca/fish-creek.aspx">Fish Creek Park</a>&mdash;a totally new venture for me! I'm not much of a downhill skier, but <em>this</em> I can handle (mostly)! We also enjoyed a night hike in <a href="http://www.banff.com/banff-helpers/things-to-do-in-banff/johnston-canyon/">Johnston Canyon</a> and played tourist in Banff. Yay, winter sports!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/dodgeball.jpg" width="250" height="225" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  F</span>ebruary was finally time to take down the Christmas tree.</strong> Andrew and I were always a bit nostalgic for Christmas (it's not a laziness issue at all). Oh, and in case anyone was worried, our dodgeball team, the Honey Badgers, continued strong into the new season! Now that may be a subjective opinion, so please refrain from looking up our <a href="http://www.calgarydodgeball.ca/teams.php?select=true&teamselect=Honey%20Badgers">stats</a>. But hey, no <a href="http://xmas.suder.mn/2011">broken bones</a> this year!
  


<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Janessa's baby horse Layla was nearly three years old. So, Nessa strapped on her helmet and hopped on for her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152557795800174">first ride</a> and she wasn't bucked off! Success! Ever since, Ness has been training Layla while I ride Dawn (Layla's mom). The goal is to eventually trade horses, so Layla will be my regular set of hooves, and Ness can finally have her Dawn back!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
Canadian winters are long, so we stayed warm celebrating Jessica's (my sister) birthday with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152602088545174">Hawaiian luau party</a>. She's been going to school in Edmonton, which was convenient for her boyfriend James, who lives near the city. We only met James a few months earlier, but he's a really good guy! Good find, Jess!</p>

<!-- <img align="right" src="easter.jpg" width="260" height="245" /> -->

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  M</span>arch marked my realization I hadn't been on a trip since last summer.</strong> This was intentional&mdash;Ness and I were saving for our wedding, and there was still much left to do. I spent a lot of this month working on the <a href="http://www.nessjon.com/files/suderman-wedding-invite.jpg">wedding invites</a> and the <a href="http://www.nessjon.com">wedding website</a> (which Ness helped out doing most of the writing). Easter was shared with both sides of the family, one day after the other. It's nice we haven't been forced to choose yet!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/dinner.jpg" width="250" height="245" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>pril approached and the clock kept ticking.</strong> We had to find an apartment to move into once married, and Andrew and I had to decide what to do about the house we owned together. He ultimately decided to buy it from me, and I'm happy the house staying in the family for now. We learned all the ins and outs of mortgage rules and land title law... boy am I sure glad <em>that's</em> behind us! By the end of the month, Ness and I snapped up a modest apartment in Capitol Hill that we're both we're quite pleased with.</p>

<img align="right" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/hula.jpg" width="300" height="324" /> 

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">We pretended to be in Hawaii again at our second luau party celebrating Connie's (Janessa's mom) birthday. Can you tell we miss the tropics? I was also treated to Ness taking me out a "blind date" involving an <em>actual blindfold</em> and her leading me around a <a href="http://www.pumphousetheatre.ca/mainstructure/homepage.htm">theatre</a> in utter darkness, with people staring (I can only assume). She's really cute that way. We also began our premarital counseling, which has proven to be a valuable asset in our new marriage.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/marathon.jpg" width="312" height="398" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  M</span>ay, as usual, was the month of running!</strong> Once again, I was proud of Janessa for completing the 5k at the annual <a href="http://www.mdrunandwalk.com">Mother's Day race</a>. My whole family all participated, including my mom, dad, Andrew, Jessica and of course, Braden! The bigger race looming, however, was the <a href="http://www.calgarymarathon.com">Calgary Marathon</a>. This training season didn't have ideal weather, so I spent a lot of time preparing on my treadmill (something I <em>do miss</em> in our new apartment). I finished <a href="http://www.startlinetiming.com/races/2013/calgarymarathon/oallmarathon_detailed.txt">704/988</a> with a time of 4:38:44 (six minutes slower than last year&mdash;I'll make it up next year, I promise!). <a href="http://www.marathonfoto.com/Marathon/Scotiabank-Calgary-Race-Weekend-2013/offering/myMarathonfotos/RaceOID/27012013S1/Language/en">Andrew</a> also ran the full, and my <a href="http://www.marathonfoto.com/Marathon/Scotiabank-Calgary-Race-Weekend-2013/offering/myMarathonfotos/RaceOID/27012013S1/Language/en">dad</a>, Jess and <a href="http://www.marathonfoto.com/Marathon/Scotiabank-Calgary-Race-Weekend-2013/offering/myMarathonfotos/RaceOID/27012013S1/Language/en">Braden</a> ran the half marathon. Ness was an animated cheerleader, even crossing the <a href="http://www.marathonfoto.com/Marathon/Scotiabank-Calgary-Race-Weekend-2013/offering/myMarathonfotos/RaceOID/27012013S1/Language/en">finish line</a> with me! No, supporters are <em>not supposed</em> to do that. ;-)</p>

<img align="right" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/cousin.jpg" width="344" height="280" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Near the end of the month, I went on one last family road trip without Ness. We drove through the night to Vancouver, Washington to see my cousin Sara's wedding. It was awesome supporting her, visiting my American relatives and spending time with my immediate family, but it was also a reminder that I don't like travelling without my (soon-to-be) bride!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  J</span>une crept in and so did my 31st birthday.</strong> We celebrated by spending the weekend hiking in <a href="http://www.banfflakelouise.com/Things-To-Do/Summer-Adventures/Hiking-in-Banff-and-Lake-Louise">Lake Louise</a> with my family, James, and Janessa's father, Kevin. The fun continued with bridal showers&mdash;one hosted by my <a href="http://www.bonavistachurch.ca/">Bonavista church</a> (I was a surprise guest), and one hosted by Janessa's <a href="http://bergenmissionarychurch.ca/">Bergen church</a> (I was actually <em>supposed</em> to be there)! It was really touching seeing so many people support our upcoming marriage. </p>

<img align="left" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/flood.jpg" width="344" height="280" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  Just when we started to feel like we were ready for the big day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Alberta_floods">the floods came</a>. Downtown Calgary was underwater (including my work's building), but what concerned us most was the <a href="http://www.windsorstar.com/news/Gallery+stunning+photos+from+flooded+Calgary/9218651/story.html">Calgary Zoo</a>: our animal-themed island venue was destroyed. With only two weeks before the date, we felt devastated. It was the first real challenge Janessa and I had to face together in our <em>(almost)</em> marriage, and everyone was so incredibly supportive, offering their help. God was faithful and we secured two new venues&mdash;and they weren't available last fall! In fact, these were venues we had considered before settling on the zoo, so the final decision was simple... and quite frankly, miraculous. With how the wedding day turned out, you'd had thought we originally planned it this way all along. We learned a lesson about control: it's never truly ours to own, but always in the hands of God.</p>

<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/party.jpg" width="650" height="330" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">
  J</span>uly was the happiest month of my life.</strong> That first week, all of our family and friends began to gather in Calgary. Janessa's bridesmaids, Heather (her maid of honour), Catherine, Steph, Christina (her cousin), and Jessica adventured downtown wearing bright feather boas on a bachelorette scavenger hunt. Meanwhile, my groomsmen, Andrew (my best man), <a href="http://www.brocktyler.com/">Brock</a>, Dan, David (my cousin), and Luke were among those at my bachelor party, championing <a href="http://www.silverwillow.ca">guns and glory</a>. </p>

<img align="right" src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/wedding.jpg" width="380" height="380" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  The rehearsal dinner was held at our new ceremony site, <a href="http://www.lakesundance.org">Lake Sundance</a>. This is a community park near my parents' house and they hosted us with a big barbecue feed. We were honoured by the huge assembly of loved ones who shared their memories and wisdom, and blessed us with their presence. Admittedly, the excitement in the air may have been heightened due to the fact this wedding was the first for my family and also Janessa's! And looking ahead now, we may have sparked a trend...</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
That was my last night staying in the house I purchased with Andrew. It wasn't a restful sleep... I was far too excited for slumber! While getting dressed, I had to make the final decision if we'd brave the rain clouds for our outdoor ceremony or switch to our backup indoor venue. I gambled in favour of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153111112075174.1073741829.539475173&type=1&l=dd513c272e">outdoor wedding</a> Janessa had always dreamed of... and the rain held off <em>(mostly)</em>! It was a <a href="http://nessjon.com/files/suderman-wedding-program.pdf">beautiful ceremony</a>, and Janessa surprised everyone by declaring her vows to me in song. My eyes were not dry after that.</p>

<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/family.jpg" width="650" height="390" /> 

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
The new venue for our dinner reception was held at the <a href="https://www.heritagepark.ca/bookings-and-functions/venues/wainwright-hotel.html">Wainwright Hotel</a> in Heritage Park, a historical village in Calgary. It's an old-timey rustic setting&mdash;well suited for the lifestyle Janessa had grown up with in the country. After a big meal, and being honoured with speeches &amp; toasts, the newlyweds and their guests danced until the venue shut down. It was perfect, and the whole experience is forever etched into our memories.</p>

<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2013/reception.jpg" width="650" height="375" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
The following day was spent at Janessa's parents acreage, and permitted us to spend more quality time with the friends and family who travelled so far to see us. We didn't stick around for too long, though... we were anxious for some serious honeymooning! Janessa had no idea what our destination was, and I had just told her to pack for the beach. Sneaky! Well, I surpised my new bride with ten days on the island of <a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/kauai">Kauai</a>, finally able to relax (planning a wedding <em>twice</em> is a lot of work)! We stayed a couple of nights on the south shore at the <a href="http://www.sheraton-kauai.com/">Sheraton Resort</a>, and the rest our time on the north shore in <a href="http://www.princeville.com/">Princeville</a>. Highlights included an amazing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153055839065174.1073741828.539475173&type=1&l=79f136b1fb">helicopter tour</a>, a delicious <a href="http://www.smithskauai.com/luau.html">luau feast</a> (finally <em>in Hawaii</em> this time!), and a tropical hike along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nā_Pali_Coast_State_Park">Napoli coast</a>, beyond the bamboo forest, and finishing at Hanakapi`ai Falls. What a perfect start to the rest of our lives!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
An advantage to vacationing in July is that you return home to warm weather. Taking full advantage of the season, we joined Janessa's parents in <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/banff/activ/cheval-horse/YaHaTinda.aspx">Ya Ha Tinda</a> for a camping trip with the horses! I've never gone riding in the mountains before, and was quickly introduced to the adventures of riding in the Rockies and hurrying back to camp before the hail storm hit. Yes, we had fun!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>ugust arrived as Ness and I continued to adjust to living together.</strong> Our apartment is near <a href="http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Parks/Pages/Locations/NW-parks/Confederation-Park.aspx">Confederation Park</a>, and so we spent most evenings walking beneath the trees, often feeding the ducks. Of course, we were in the heart of hiking season, so another big challenge was ahead: The Skyline Trail. Janessa and I drove north to <a href="http://www.jasper.travel">Jasper</a> along with her father, Kevin, my family, Braden, the Fox family, and others from <a href="http://bemcoutdoorclub.wordpress.com">Bonavista's Outdoor Club</a>. We spent two days hiking on top of the world, staying at the <a href="http://www.skylinetrail.com">Shovel Pass Lodge</a> overnight.</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
 I think that hike was only a warm-up for what Andrew had next: <a href="http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman/canada.aspx">Ironman Canada</a>! Janessa and I road tripped to <a href="http://www.whistler.ca">Whistler</a> to cheer him on&mdash;and did he have a lot of support: Ness and I, my family, James, Kirstin, Braden, Doreen, and the Berkans!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
After Andrew finished his <a href="http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/coverage/athlete-tracker.aspx?race=canada&y=2013">226 km triathlon</a>, most of us celebrated by going further west and setting sail on a ship destined for <a href="http://www.ncl.com/cruise-destination/alaska/overview">Alaska</a>! James, Doreen and Braden couldn't come on the cruise, but we did board with the Fox family (we made quite the big group!). The ship's course allowed us to see <a href="http://www.city.ketchikan.ak.us">Ketchikan</a>, <a href="http://www.juneau.org">Juneau</a>, <a href="http://skagway.com">Skagway</a>, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glba/index.htm">Glacier Bay National Park</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_Glacier">Hubbard Glacier</a>. Cruising in the mountains and seeing the glaciers as close as we did was incredible. I've never seen so much ice&mdash;and I grew up in Winnipeg! </p>

  S</span>eptember was month Janessa turned 26!</strong> We celebrated enjoying a <a href="http://www.stagewestcalgary.com">Stage West</a> dinner theatre with her parents. We also visited the Calgary Zoo for the first time since the flood. Speaking of subaqueous, I was long overdue finishing my open water dives. And so, after two sessions at <a href="http://www.lakechap.ca/cra/">Lake Chaparral</a> (the visibility was terrible, but I wasn't there to see the fish), I finally obtained my <a href="https://www.padi.com/scuba/">SCUBA certification</a>! Now this sport is either really exhausting or I was getting out of shape... but Andrew helped out by lending us his <a href="http://www.racermateinc.com">training bike</a> for indoor cycling&mdash;an exercise solution to replace my unwelcome treadmill in the apartment.</p>

  O</span>ctober offered an opportunity to get fit</strong>&mdash;the <a href="http://www.harvesthalfmarathon.com">Harvest Half Marathon</a>. <a href="http://www.marathon-photos.com/scripts/event.py?template=MPX2&new_search=1&event=Sports%2FSTCA%2F2013%2FHarvest%20Half%20Marathon&match=28">I ran</a> this race along with <a href="http://www.marathon-photos.com/scripts/event.py?template=MPX2&new_search=1&event=Sports%2FSTCA%2F2013%2FHarvest%20Half%20Marathon&match=46">Andrew</a>, <a href="http://www.marathon-photos.com/scripts/event.py?template=MPX2&new_search=1&event=Sports%2FSTCA%2F2013%2FHarvest%20Half%20Marathon&match=695">Mack</a> (Janessa's younger brother) and <a href="http://www.marathon-photos.com/scripts/event.py?template=MPX2&new_search=1&event=Sports%2FSTCA%2F2013%2FHarvest%20Half%20Marathon&match=694">Tia</a>. Of course, Janessa was an amazing cheerleader once again, meeting me a multiple spots on the course! Thanksgiving was celebrated with both families. The Sheppards had a massive meal followed by a peaceful horse ride in the woods, watching the changing leaves fall. But before that meal, Janessa and I ate with the Sudermans, including Jessica and James visiting from Edmonton. It was during a game of Monopoly that Jessica picked up a Chance card instructing her to notice James <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10153356674290174">down on one knee</a>. She said yes, and we have another summer wedding to look forward to next year!</p>

  N</span>ovember notched my sixth year</strong> working at <a href="http://www.nonfiction.ca/">nonfiction studios</a>, still writing code and making the Internet bigger (among <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OkNcIWrt3k">other distractions</a>). Nessie has been working in public health as an RN east of Calgary, way out in Strathmore. It's a much longer commute than my own 15 minute jaunt, but everyone there loves her! She's also been keeping busy at our new church, <a href="http://www.cschurch.ca">Centre Street Church</a>, singing on their choir and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10153480848965174">worship teams</a>.</p>

 By this point, the days had gotten darker and colder, so Ness and I took a long weekend escape to California. We flew a kite on Huntington Beach, visited the pandas at San Diego Zoo, and marveled at the Mickey Magic in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10153523123295174">Disneyland</a> and California Adventure Park. While visiting Downtown Disney, we were surprised to see tourists ice skating on an outdoor rink! Not too tempting for Canadians, though... we prefer to focus on the palm trees!</p>

  D</span>ecember dropped on us</strong> before Andrew had a chance to throw the annual November Christmas Party. So instead, we had it late in the more seasonally appropriate month. Janessa snagged a solo for Centre Street Church's big <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10153616883575174">Christmas concert</a> and the families all attended to enjoy our angel sing with an orchestra and backup choir!</p>

 Christmas Eve was spent with the Suderman family, complete with appetizers, carols, and a candlelit Christmas Eve service. Ness and I had our first Christmas morning together, alone, in our apartment. We then drove north to be with the Sheppards for a big Christmas feast with family &amp; friends. The Sudermans (and Braden) later joined in, combining both sides of our families into one mega-party spectacular! There was food, fun, and the family band singing Christmas songs (and eventually Elvis hits) until late into the night.</p>

  The remainder of our holidays were enjoyed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, finally experiencing the Deep South, y'all. We drove to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a>, <a href="http://breauxbridgelive.com">Breaux Bridge</a>, at the <a href="http://www.nottoway.com">Nottoway Plantation</a> to get a good taste of Cajun Country. The next several days were in <a href="http://www.nola.gov/home/">New Orleans</a>, celebrating New Years Eve at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Square_(New_Orleans)">Jackson Square</a> in the <a href="http://www.frenchquarter.com">French Quarter</a>. Before returning to the cold, we relaxed aboard a cruise ship destined for <a href="http://www.cozumel.travel">Cozumel, Mexico</a>. We arrived home on the day of our six-month wedding anniversary, still madly in love. ;-)</p>

  T</span>wenty-thirteen began single and anxious, but finished in wedded bliss!</strong> Much has changed for both of us, but in all the right ways. We hope your past year was well-spent and that the year ahead is filled with fun and adventure! Until next time, God bless!</p>
