    <h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing:3px;">Blessings!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">I</span>&rsquo;m sure you counted them as 2009 rolled over to 2010</strong>, thinking I&rsquo;ve given up spamming my address book each year. But behold! I have created the January Christmas Letter! Indeed, the idea is as ingenious as my February Christmas tree will be, later on. Here we go!</p>
    
    <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/disney.jpg" width="375" align="right" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">      
      <strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">J</span>anuary 2009 had a lot in common with January 2008. </strong> Once again, I returned to Orlando Florida to participate in the <em style="font-style:italic;">Walt Disney World Marathon</em> with Andrew and Braden. This was my third full marathon and it&rsquo;s still my favourite course to run, by far. Andrew and I raised the bar this year by signing up for the &ldquo;<em style="font-style:italic;">Goofy Challenge</em>.&rdquo; In addition to running to the full marathon on Sunday, we also ran the half marathon the day before, on Saturday. Finishers receive a bonus medal effectively TRIPLING our bling-count from last year! There&rsquo;s no sound more glorious than three Disney-shaped medals clanging against my chest. Even better, my time was a new personal best as I finally finished under five hours!</p>
      
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">The mood quickly changed gears, though, when I received a phone call that my Grandpa George had passed away. A week after the race, Andrew and I flew to Vancouver, Washington for the funeral. We (embarrassingly) missed our flight, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the Berkans, Andrew and I arrived just in time. Sad occasion, for sure, but it was really great to see all my relatives together in one place. </p>
    
<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/cruise.jpg" align="left" width="470" style="float:left; padding-right:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">F</span>ebruary was still cold, so going south again sounded real good.</strong> The destination was the Mexican Riviera and our group featured Shawn and Alex of Winnipeg, Andrew and some friends he met through work, including Doreen, Donna, Kersten and Jonathan. Together we boarded a cruise ship destined for Peurto Vallarta, Mazatl&aacute;n and Cabo San Lucas. Of course, disembarking in Los Angeles demanded a stop in Disneyland. The climate was excellent and the times were grand.</p>
    
  <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/ski.jpg" width="460" align="right" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />  
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">M</span>arch was a quieter month.</strong> I suppose I actually had to endure SOME local weather. I don&rsquo;t go often, but I did spend a weekend on the slopes at Sunshine Village. Skiing is a lot of fun if you dress for it and wear boots that actually fit!</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>pril and May were spent running!</strong> Early April, Andrew and I ran the <em style="font-style:italic;">Hustle for Hunger</em> 10k, and I recall feeling rather chilly. Later that month, mom and dad joined us for the <em style="font-style:italic;">Tour de Airdrie</em> half marathon, and I recall feeling rather dehydrated. Early May, we all ran another half marathon known as the <em style="font-style:italic;">Theatre Calgary Big Run</em>. Jessica and Kersten were there too and ran the 10k edition. The next weekend, we were all running 10k&rsquo;s at the <em style="font-style:italic;">Mother&rsquo;s Day 10k</em> event in downtown Calgary. I&rsquo;m particularly fond of this race because you can count on receiving chocolate milk at the finish line! </p>
    
<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/marathon.jpg" align="left" width="470" style="float:left; padding-right:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />    
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">However, it was the big race at the end of May that merited a visit from the Berkans. Of course, I refer to the <em style="font-style:italic;">Calgary Marathon</em>, featuring participants such as mom, dad and yours truly. It was my fourth full marathon, and I was thrilled with my time, beating it down to 4:36. Also, this was my mom&rsquo;s first full marathon and she was right on my tail! Jess and the Berkans ran the half marathon and Braden ran the 10k. Andrew <em style="font-style:italic;">planned</em> on running (of course!) but was forced to the sidelines after he got hit by a car a few days prior. He&rsquo;s back on feet now, but at the time he had to settle for a &ldquo;race crew&rdquo; shirt and shout encouragements to the rest of us. Silver lining? It&rsquo;s not often I come out the fastest Suderman in the results!</p>
    
  <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/cowboy.jpg" width="236" align="right" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />  
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">J</span>une arrived at that meant it was time to be twenty-seven. Zoinks!</strong> Feeling rather old, I was motivated to begin a beautiful relationship&hellip; with a realtor. Andrew and I decided we ought to buy a house together, or rather, if we wanted to buy a house at all, it <em style="font-style:italic;">had</em> to be together. Anyone who knows me knows how much I hate shopping. Well, browsing home after home is basically shopping times a million, so I can&rsquo;t say June was an easy month! But thankfully, July came and the realtor found exactly what we wanted! It&rsquo;s a bi-level in Shawnessy, with a garage, backyard, deck, fireplace&mdash; everything necessary to ease the pain of taking on a mortgage! The day the seller accepted our offer was very memorable to me, because I was in the Grandstand during the Calgary Stampede for a client party. Everyone knew why I kept checking my phone that night, and when I was able to tell them the happy news, it was like the celebration party was ready to go! Yeehaw!</p>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">One more fun thing about the Stampede: I was given a gate pass for the week and visited the grounds every single day for lunch. It&rsquo;s amazing how many different foods you can deep-fry!</p>
     <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/winnipeg.jpg" width="650" style="padding-bottom:10px;" />  
     
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>ugust was an opportunity to visit Winnipeg</strong>, all because my friend Paul was getting hitched! Weddings are great for reunions with old friends and I had a wonderful time seeing people I haven&rsquo;t seen in years! I also had the chance to visit with my grandma and grandpa and all the relatives. Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention my visit to the Salisbury House. Aint nothin&rsquo; greasier!</p>
    
<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/banff.jpg" align="left" width="220" style="float:left; padding-right:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />      

    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Later that month, the whole family spent the weekend at the Banff Springs Hotel. Of course, this is all thanks to Doreen and her excellent Sheraton/Fairmont connections. The group of us, including Donna and Braden, experienced a weekend of fabulous luxury and half-price buffets!</p>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">We&rsquo;d come to appreciate Doreen even more when she hooked us up in Penticton, BC, later that month. Andrew was participating in <em style="font-style:italic;">Ironman Canada</em> (this makes three, for anyone counting) and his gusto lured a visit from the Berkans (again!) along with Uncle Rod and Aunt Betty-Jo. Andrew did well, especially considering the fever he suffered the night before. Still, he looked very, very tired!</p>
    
    <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/ironman.jpg" width="650" style="padding-bottom:10px;" /> 
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">S</span>eptember was when I finally found some time settle in the new house.</strong> Braden escaped Cranston and joined us in &ldquo;Sudermanor&rdquo; (we are much obliged for his company). It turns out moving is a lot of work! Andrew was determined to use the last of the summer weather to build a brick pathway in the backyard, a task which proved challenging and expensive! The results are fantastic, thankfully. Other renovations were building a network closet, wiring the house with ethernet/HDMI cable, and creating the much-needed home theatre in the basement! I&rsquo;ll admit, none of my &ldquo;renovations&rdquo; are very&hellip; aesthetic. We&rsquo;ll paint and buy pictures for the walls later, I guess!</p>
    
    <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/wave.jpg" width="650" style="padding-bottom:10px;" />  
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">O</span>ctober was a month I just couldn&rsquo;t wait for&mdash; a trip to paradise!</strong> The web development team at nonfiction studios (where I work) was sent to a conference called &ldquo;Aloha on Rails&rdquo; which just so happened to take place in Waikiki, Hawaii. <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/hawaii.jpg" width="390" align="right" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" /> I had an amazing time and am in love with the island of Oahu! The conference itself was fascinating and I really enjoyed hanging out with the guys I see everyday, but in a totally tropical setting. I also fit in some early morning runs up the Diamond Head, but the other guys didn&rsquo;t take as much interest in that&hellip;</p>
    
<img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/halloween.jpg" align="left" width="280" style="float:left; padding-right:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />  
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">The rest of the month was party-time at Sudermanor. We kicked it off with a poorly attended &ldquo;Windows 7 launch party&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t ask), followed by a very well attended &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s 50th birthday party&rdquo; and finally a spooky halloween party with Dan and Emily and kids. I was very happy with the turn-out&mdash; looks like we live in a neighbourhood with plenty of trick-or-treaters... good!</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">N</span>ovember, we trimmed the Christmas tree and decorated the house with what we had.</strong> Of course, this was all in preparation for our last house party of the year, the November Christmas Party. It&rsquo;s much easier to get attendees if you do these things nice and early! Other celebrations this month were held by our dodgeball team for finishing the season and not coming in dead last. Go team!</p>
    
  <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/candle.jpg" width="230" align="right" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;padding-bottom:5px;" />      
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">D</span>ecember presented an opportunity for my first race in a while&mdash;</strong> <em style="font-style:italic;">Catch the Elves</em> 10k. Andrew and I bundled up beneath four layers and ran downtown in minus 30&deg;C, certainly the coldest run I&rsquo;ve endured yet! That weekend, my grandparents were visiting from Winnipeg, and they graciously helped fix several things in the house. Most importantly, grandma stocked my freezer with cinnamon buns!</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">My Christmas holiday was spent with my family&mdash; all week long. Christmas morning was shared with Mickey in Disneyland and Boxing Day was observed on a cruise ship (another one!). Once again this year, I found myself en route to Cabo San Lucas, watching whales and lazing about on the beach. A most welcome escape from your typical Canadian December, I think! It wasn't until New Year's Day, 2010, that we arrived home again. That&rsquo;s my excuse for the tardiness of this letter, anyway!</p>
    
 <img src="http://xmas.suder.mn/2009/beach.jpg" width="650" style="padding-bottom:10px;" />      
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>nd that&rsquo;s it!</strong> I do hope this letter finds you well and that 2010 will be as futuristic as it sounds! Only five more years until flying cars, pink hoverboards, and Jaws 19, you guys!</p>
